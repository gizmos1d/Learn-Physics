Hello there!
If you want to learn physics, then you should probably read these books
1. College Physics - 2E
2. The Physics Book: Big Ideas Simply Explained

   I learnt some basic physics from these books, such as linear motion, thermal energy, entropy, Gauss' law, etc.
   You can too learn many other if you read these books
